## Purpose

this project is meant to be a mock cannabis online store and no there is no intention to sell or distribute any kind of product, I purposefully omitted adding a cart and checkout feature due to the nature of the website and for legal reasons. The other purpose of the project was to expand my knowledge in typescript and nextjs and react, learn more about building orms and building api routes. I can say that I am more confident in building both the front and the backend, I still lack a bit in styling with css and desgining the UI but with more projects I will get a better grasp of it.

There is no intention to sell any substance on this website
